if it looks weird just zoom out until it doesn't, the client said he didn't want it responsive if I remember correctly

## WORKING WITH PHP
if you have XAMPP installed:
  1. drag and drop the folder "NSC Labs (PHP)" into your htdocs directory
  2. go to your browser and type "localhost/NSC Labs (PHP)/"
  3. edit stuff 

If you don't have XAMPP:
  1. Install it
  2. enable both 'Apache' and 'MySQL' modules in the control panel
